## WebScraping

It was a project which I did to scrap data of students from my university's website and make a dashboard for students to see their progress over every semester. The idea was to make a chrome extension and when a student visits the university's website to see his result by entering the roll number, the extension would capture that data and send it over to our database and then further processing would take place. It is not having any frontend component as of now. The library used for scraping is Cheerio.
